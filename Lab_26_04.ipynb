        "Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, abbreviated as LASSO or lasso, is an LR technique which also performs regularisation on variables in consideration. In fact, it almost shares a similar statistical analysis evident in ridge regression, except it differs in the regularisation values. This means, it considers the absolute values of the sum of the regression coefficients (hence the term was coined on this ‘shrinkage’ feature). It even sets the coefficients to zero thus reducing the errors completely. In the ridge equation mentioned earlier, the ‘e’ component has absolute values instead of squared values.\n",

        "This method was proposed by Professor Robert Tibshirani from the University of Toronto, Canada. He said, “The Lasso minimises the residual sum of squares to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint, it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models”.\n",
        "\n",
        "In his journal article titled Regression Shrinkage and Selection via the Lasso, Tibshirani gives an account of this technique with respect to various other statistical models such as subset selection and ridge regression.
